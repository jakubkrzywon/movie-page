# Movie website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


I've created website about movies. Whole content is basen on my own facebook fanpage "PrzeglÄ…d kinowy". Website is created in react. I've made my own rest API, which one I edited in postman computer program.

To run this app please:
1. Clone it.
2. Run java server by enter in console "java -jar ServerApp.jar".
3. Run repository by enter in console npm start.
